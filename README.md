# Clean-Code # 
This is a summary of the famous book "Clean Code-A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin


## Chapter 2 - Meaningful Names ## 

#### Use Intention-Revealing Names ####
* The name of the variable, function, or class should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. 
* If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.

#### Avoid Disinformation ####
* Avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. For example, Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`. It may lead false conclusions. So `accountGroup` or `bunchOfAccount` would be better choice.
